FunBlocker is a script to remove annoying posts in Facebook, mainly funny [re]posts.

Install JavaScript Injector (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/abdogfafejmdomllalkdegagoehgbdbk) and add main.js code to http://www.facebook.com URL.

You can add/remove ignored profiles in main.js code.

I accept any suggestions about how to improve this script. I really want to vanish these posts.
