FunBlocker is a script to remove annoying posts in Facebook, mainly funny [re]posts.

You need Google Chrome with JavaScript Injector plugin to use this script.

JavaScript Injector: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/abdogfafejmdomllalkdegagoehgbdbk

Add main.js code to http://www.facebook.com URL, using JavaScript Injector.

You can add/remove ignored profiles in main.js code.

I accept any suggestions about how to improve this script. I really want to vanish these posts.
